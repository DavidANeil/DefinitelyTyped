     * the product of a callback or errback. The list's completion criteria and
     * result list may be modified by setting one or more of the boolean options
     * documented below.
     *
     * <code>Deferred</code> instances passed into a <code>DeferredList</code> are
     * independent, and may have additional callbacks and errbacks added to their
     * execution sequences after they are passed as inputs to the list.
