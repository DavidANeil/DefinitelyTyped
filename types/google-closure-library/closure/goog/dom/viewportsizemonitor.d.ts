     * This class can be used to monitor changes in the viewport size.  Instances
     * dispatch a {@link goog.events.EventType.RESIZE} event when the viewport size
     * changes.  Handlers can call {@link goog.dom.ViewportSizeMonitor#getSize} to
     * get the new viewport size.
     *
     * Use this class if you want to execute resize/reflow logic each time the
     * user resizes the browser window.  This class is guaranteed to only dispatch
     * `RESIZE` events when the pixel dimensions of the viewport change.
     * (Internet Explorer fires resize events if any element on the page is resized,
     * even if the viewport dimensions are unchanged, which can lead to infinite
     * resize loops.)
     *
     * Example usage:
     *  <pre>
     *    var vsm = new goog.dom.ViewportSizeMonitor();
     *    goog.events.listen(vsm, goog.events.EventType.RESIZE, function(e) {
     *      alert('Viewport size changed to ' + vsm.getSize());
     *    });
     *  </pre>
     *
     * Manually verified on IE6, IE7, FF2, Opera 11, Safari 4 and Chrome.
