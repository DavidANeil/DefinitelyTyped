     * A class to handle targeted CSS3 transition. This class
     * handles common features required for targeted CSS3 transition.
     *
     * Browser that does not support CSS3 transition will still receive all
     * the events fired by the transition object, but will not have any transition
     * played. If the browser supports the final state as set in setFinalState
     * method, the element will ends in the final state.
     *
     * Transitioning multiple properties with the same setting is possible
     * by setting Css3Property's property to 'all'. Performing multiple
     * transitions can be done via setting multiple initialStyle,
     * finalStyle and transitions. Css3Property's delay can be used to
     * delay one of the transition. Here is an example for a transition
     * that expands on the width and then followed by the height:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   var animation = new goog.fx.css3.Transition(
     *     element,
     *     duration,
     *     {width: 10px, height: 10px},
     *     {width: 100px, height: 100px},
     *     [
     *       {property: width, duration: 1, timing: 'ease-in', delay: 0},
     *       {property: height, duration: 1, timing: 'ease-in', delay: 1}
     *     ]
     *   );
     * </pre>
     *
     * @extends {goog.fx.TransitionBase}
     * @struct
